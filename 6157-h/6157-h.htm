     &ldquo;Whoso hath the world&rsquo;s goods, and beholdeth his brother in

    <h2>
      WHAT MEN LIVE BY
    </h2>
    <p>
      A shoemaker named Simon, who had neither house nor land of his own, lived
      with his wife and children in a peasant&rsquo;s hut, and earned his living by
      his work. Work was cheap, but bread was dear, and what he earned he spent
      for food. The man and his wife had but one sheepskin coat between them for
      winter wear, and even that was torn to tatters, and this was the second
      year he had been wanting to buy sheep-skins for a new coat. Before winter
      Simon saved up a little money: a three-rouble note lay hidden in his
      wife&rsquo;s box, and five roubles and twenty kopeks were owed him by customers
      in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one morning he prepared to go to the village to buy the sheep-skins. He
      put on over his shirt his wife&rsquo;s wadded nankeen jacket, and over that he
      put his own cloth coat. He took the three-rouble note in his pocket, cut
      himself a stick to serve as a staff, and started off after breakfast.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll collect the five roubles that are due to me,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;add the
      three I have got, and that will be enough to buy sheep-skins for the
      winter coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came to the village and called at a peasant&rsquo;s hut, but the man was not
      at home. The peasant&rsquo;s wife promised that the money should be paid next
      week, but she would not pay it herself. Then Simon called on another
      peasant, but this one swore he had no money, and would only pay twenty
      kopeks which he owed for a pair of boots Simon had mended. Simon then
      tried to buy the sheep-skins on credit, but the dealer would not trust
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring your money,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;then you may have your pick of the skins. We
      know what debt-collecting is like.&rdquo; So all the business the shoemaker did
      was to get the twenty kopeks for boots he had mended, and to take a pair
      of felt boots a peasant gave him to sole with leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon felt downhearted. He spent the twenty kopeks on vodka, and started
      homewards without having bought any skins. In the morning he had felt the
      frost; but now, after drinking the vodka, he felt warm, even without a
      sheep-skin coat. He trudged along, striking his stick on the frozen earth
      with one hand, swinging the felt boots with the other, and talking to
      himself.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite warm,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though I have no sheep-skin coat. I&rsquo;ve had a
      drop, and it runs through all my veins. I need no sheep-skins. I go along
      and don&rsquo;t worry about anything. That&rsquo;s the sort of man I am! What do I
      care? I can live without sheep-skins. I don&rsquo;t need them. My wife will
      fret, to be sure. And, true enough, it is a shame; one works all day long,
      and then does not get paid. Stop a bit! If you don&rsquo;t bring that money
      along, sure enough I&rsquo;ll skin you, blessed if I don&rsquo;t. How&rsquo;s that? He pays
      twenty kopeks at a time! What can I do with twenty kopeks? Drink it-that&rsquo;s
      all one can do! Hard up, he says he is! So he may be&mdash;but what about
      me? You have a house, and cattle, and everything; I&rsquo;ve only what I stand
      up in! You have corn of your own growing; I have to buy every grain. Do
      what I will, I must spend three roubles every week for bread alone. I come
      home and find the bread all used up, and I have to fork out another rouble
      and a half. So just pay up what you owe, and no nonsense about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time he had nearly reached the shrine at the bend of the road.
      Looking up, he saw something whitish behind the shrine. The daylight was
      fading, and the shoemaker peered at the thing without being able to make
      out what it was. &ldquo;There was no white stone here before. Can it be an ox?
      It&rsquo;s not like an ox. It has a head like a man, but it&rsquo;s too white; and
      what could a man be doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came closer, so that it was clearly visible. To his surprise it really
      was a man, alive or dead, sitting naked, leaning motionless against the
      shrine. Terror seized the shoemaker, and he thought, &ldquo;Some one has killed
      him, stripped him, and left him there. If I meddle I shall surely get into
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the shoemaker went on. He passed in front of the shrine so that he
      could not see the man. When he had gone some way, he looked back, and saw
      that the man was no longer leaning against the shrine, but was moving as
      if looking towards him. The shoemaker felt more frightened than before,
      and thought, &ldquo;Shall I go back to him, or shall I go on? If I go near him
      something dreadful may happen. Who knows who the fellow is? He has not
      come here for any good. If I go near him he may jump up and throttle me,
      and there will be no getting away. Or if not, he&rsquo;d still be a burden on
      one&rsquo;s hands. What could I do with a naked man? I couldn&rsquo;t give him my last
      clothes. Heaven only help me to get away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the shoemaker hurried on, leaving the shrine behind him-when suddenly
      his conscience smote him, and he stopped in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, Simon?&rdquo; said he to himself. &ldquo;The man may be dying of
      want, and you slip past afraid. Have you grown so rich as to be afraid of
      robbers? Ah, Simon, shame on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he turned back and went up to the man.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Simon approached the stranger, looked at him, and saw that he was a young
      man, fit, with no bruises on his body, only evidently freezing and
      frightened, and he sat there leaning back without looking up at Simon, as
      if too faint to lift his eyes. Simon went close to him, and then the man
      seemed to wake up. Turning his head, he opened his eyes and looked into
      Simon&rsquo;s face. That one look was enough to make Simon fond of the man. He
      threw the felt boots on the ground, undid his sash, laid it on the boots,
      and took off his cloth coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a time for talking,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Come, put this coat on at once!&rdquo;
       And Simon took the man by the elbows and helped him to rise. As he stood
      there, Simon saw that his body was clean and in good condition, his hands
      and feet shapely, and his face good and kind. He threw his coat over the
      man&rsquo;s shoulders, but the latter could not find the sleeves. Simon guided
      his arms into them, and drawing the coat well on, wrapped it closely about
      him, tying the sash round the man&rsquo;s waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon even took off his torn cap to put it on the man&rsquo;s head, but then his
      own head felt cold, and he thought: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite bald, while he has long
      curly hair.&rdquo; So he put his cap on his own head again. &ldquo;It will be better
      to give him something for his feet,&rdquo; thought he; and he made the man sit
      down, and helped him to put on the felt boots, saying, &ldquo;There, friend, now
      move about and warm yourself. Other matters can be settled later on. Can
      you walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man stood up and looked kindly at Simon, but could not say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo; said Simon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too cold to stay here, we must be
      getting home. There now, take my stick, and if you&rsquo;re feeling weak, lean
      on that. Now step out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man started walking, and moved easily, not lagging behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went along, Simon asked him, &ldquo;And where do you belong to?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      not from these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought as much. I know the folks hereabouts. But, how did you come to
      be there by the shrine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has some one been ill-treating you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one has ill-treated me. God has punished me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course God rules all. Still, you&rsquo;ll have to find food and shelter
      somewhere. Where do you want to go to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all the same to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon was amazed. The man did not look like a rogue, and he spoke gently,
      but yet he gave no account of himself. Still Simon thought, &ldquo;Who knows
      what may have happened?&rdquo; And he said to the stranger: &ldquo;Well then, come
      home with me, and at least warm yourself awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Simon walked towards his home, and the stranger kept up with him,
      walking at his side. The wind had risen and Simon felt it cold under his
      shirt. He was getting over his tipsiness by now, and began to feel the
      frost. He went along sniffling and wrapping his wife&rsquo;s coat round him, and
      he thought to himself: &ldquo;There now&mdash;talk about sheep-skins! I went out
      for sheep-skins and come home without even a coat to my back, and what is
      more, I&rsquo;m bringing a naked man along with me. Matryona won&rsquo;t be pleased!&rdquo;
       And when he thought of his wife he felt sad; but when he looked at the
      stranger and remembered how he had looked up at him at the shrine, his
      heart was glad.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Simon&rsquo;s wife had everything ready early that day. She had cut wood,
      brought water, fed the children, eaten her own meal, and now she sat
      thinking. She wondered when she ought to make bread: now or tomorrow?
      There was still a large piece left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Simon has had some dinner in town,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;and does not eat
      much for supper, the bread will last out another day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She weighed the piece of bread in her hand again and again, and thought:
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make any more today. We have only enough flour left to bake one
      batch; We can manage to make this last out till Friday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Matryona put away the bread, and sat down at the table to patch her
      husband&rsquo;s shirt. While she worked she thought how her husband was buying
      skins for a winter coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only the dealer does not cheat him. My good man is much too simple; he
      cheats nobody, but any child can take him in. Eight roubles is a lot of
      money&mdash;he should get a good coat at that price. Not tanned skins, but
      still a proper winter coat. How difficult it was last winter to get on
      without a warm coat. I could neither get down to the river, nor go out
      anywhere. When he went out he put on all we had, and there was nothing
      left for me. He did not start very early today, but still it&rsquo;s time he was
      back. I only hope he has not gone on the spree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Matryona thought this, when steps were heard on the threshold,
      and some one entered. Matryona stuck her needle into her work and went out
      into the passage. There she saw two men: Simon, and with him a man without
      a hat, and wearing felt boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matryona noticed at once that her husband smelt of spirits. &ldquo;There now, he
      has been drinking,&rdquo; thought she. And when she saw that he was coatless,
      had only her jacket on, brought no parcel, stood there silent, and seemed
      ashamed, her heart was ready to break with disappointment. &ldquo;He has drunk
      the money,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;and has been on the spree with some
      good-for-nothing fellow whom he has brought home with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matryona let them pass into the hut, followed them in, and saw that the
      stranger was a young, slight man, wearing her husband&rsquo;s coat. There was no
      shirt to be seen under it, and he had no hat. Having entered, he stood,
      neither moving, nor raising his eyes, and Matryona thought: &ldquo;He must be a
      bad man&mdash;he&rsquo;s afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matryona frowned, and stood beside the oven looking to see what they would
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon took off his cap and sat down on the bench as if things were all
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Matryona; if supper is ready, let us have some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matryona muttered something to herself and did not move, but stayed where
      she was, by the oven. She looked first at the one and then at the other of
      them, and only shook her head. Simon saw that his wife was annoyed, but
      tried to pass it off. Pretending not to notice anything, he took the
      stranger by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and let us have some supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger sat down on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you cooked anything for us?&rdquo; said Simon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matryona&rsquo;s anger boiled over. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve cooked, but not for you. It seems to
      me you have drunk your wits away. You went to buy a sheep-skin coat, but
      come home without so much as the coat you had on, and bring a naked
      vagabond home with you. I have no supper for drunkards like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Matryona. Don&rsquo;t wag your tongue without reason. You had
      better ask what sort of man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you tell me what you&rsquo;ve done with the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon found the pocket of the jacket, drew out the three-rouble note, and
      unfolded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the money. Trifonof did not pay, but promises to pay soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matryona got still more angry; he had bought no sheep-skins, but had put
      his only coat on some naked fellow and had even brought him to their
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She snatched up the note from the table, took it to put away in safety,
      and said: &ldquo;I have no supper for you. We can&rsquo;t feed all the naked drunkards
      in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, Matryona, hold your tongue a bit. First hear what a man has to
      say-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much wisdom I shall hear from a drunken fool. I was right in not wanting
      to marry you-a drunkard. The linen my mother gave me you drank; and now
      you&rsquo;ve been to buy a coat-and have drunk it, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon tried to explain to his wife that he had only spent twenty kopeks;
      tried to tell how he had found the man&mdash;but Matryona would not let
      him get a word in. She talked nineteen to the dozen, and dragged in things
      that had happened ten years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matryona talked and talked, and at last she flew at Simon and seized him
      by the sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me my jacket. It is the only one I have, and you must needs take it
      from me and wear it yourself. Give it here, you mangy dog, and may the
      devil take you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon began to pull off the jacket, and turned a sleeve of it inside out;
      Matryona seized the jacket and it burst its seams, She snatched it up,
      threw it over her head and went to the door. She meant to go out, but
      stopped undecided&mdash;she wanted to work off her anger, but she also
      wanted to learn what sort of a man the stranger was.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Matryona stopped and said: &ldquo;If he were a good man he would not be naked.
      Why, he hasn&rsquo;t even a shirt on him. If he were all right, you would say
      where you came across the fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I am trying to tell you,&rdquo; said Simon. &ldquo;As I came to the
      shrine I saw him sitting all naked and frozen. It isn&rsquo;t quite the weather
      to sit about naked! God sent me to him, or he would have perished. What
      was I to do? How do we know what may have happened to him? So I took him,
      clothed him, and brought him along. Don&rsquo;t be so angry, Matryona. It is a
      sin. Remember, we all must die one day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Angry words rose to Matryona&rsquo;s lips, but she looked at the stranger and
      was silent. He sat on the edge of the bench, motionless, his hands folded
      on his knees, his head drooping on his breast, his eyes closed, and his
      brows knit as if in pain. Matryona was silent: and Simon said: &ldquo;Matryona,
      have you no love of God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matryona heard these words, and as she looked at the stranger, suddenly
      her heart softened towards him. She came back from the door, and going to
      the oven she got out the supper. Setting a cup on the table, she poured
      out some kvas. Then she brought out the last piece of bread, and set out a
      knife and spoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eat, if you want to,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon drew the stranger to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your place, young man,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon cut the bread, crumbled it into the broth, and they began to eat.
      Matryona sat at the corner of the table resting her head on her hand and
      looking at the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Matryona was touched with pity for the stranger, and began to feel
      fond of him. And at once the stranger&rsquo;s face lit up; his brows were no
      longer bent, he raised his eyes and smiled at Matryona.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had finished supper, the woman cleared away the things and began
      questioning the stranger. &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not from these parts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you come to be on the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may not tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did some one rob you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God punished me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were lying there naked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, naked and freezing. Simon saw me and had pity on me. He took off his
      coat, put it on me and brought me here. And you have fed me, given me
      drink, and shown pity on me. God will reward you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matryona rose, took from the window Simon&rsquo;s old shirt she had been
      patching, and gave it to the stranger. She also brought out a pair of
      trousers for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I see you have no shirt. Put this on, and lie down
      where you please, in the loft or on the oven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger took off the coat, put on the shirt, and lay down in the
      loft. Matryona put out the candle, took the coat, and climbed to where her
      husband lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matryona drew the skirts of the coat over her and lay down, but could not
      sleep; she could not get the stranger out of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she remembered that he had eaten their last piece of bread and that
      there was none for tomorrow, and thought of the shirt and trousers she had
      given away, she felt grieved; but when she remembered how he had smiled,
      her heart was glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long did Matryona lie awake, and she noticed that Simon also was awake&mdash;he
      drew the coat towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had the last of the bread, and I have not put any to rise. I
      don&rsquo;t know what we shall do tomorrow. Perhaps I can borrow some of
      neighbor Martha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we&rsquo;re alive we shall find something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman lay still awhile, and then said, &ldquo;He seems a good man, but why
      does he not tell us who he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he has his reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We give; but why does nobody give us anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon did not know what to say; so he only said, &ldquo;Let us stop talking,&rdquo;
       and turned over and went to sleep.

    <p>
      In the morning Simon awoke. The children were still asleep; his wife had
      gone to the neighbor&rsquo;s to borrow some bread. The stranger alone was
      sitting on the bench, dressed in the old shirt and trousers, and looking
      upwards. His face was brighter than it had been the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon said to him, &ldquo;Well, friend; the belly wants bread, and the naked
      body clothes. One has to work for a living What work do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This surprised Simon, but he said, &ldquo;Men who want to learn can learn
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men work, and I will work also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Michael.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Michael, if you don&rsquo;t wish to talk about yourself, that is your own
      affair; but you&rsquo;ll have to earn a living for yourself. If you will work as
      I tell you, I will give you food and shelter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May God reward you! I will learn. Show me what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon took yarn, put it round his thumb and began to twist it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy enough&mdash;see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael watched him, put some yarn round his own thumb in the same way,
      caught the knack, and twisted the yarn also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Simon showed him how to wax the thread. This also Michael mastered.
      Next Simon showed him how to twist the bristle in, and how to sew, and
      this, too, Michael learned at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Simon showed him he understood at once, and after three days he
      worked as if he had sewn boots all his life. He worked without stopping,
      and ate little. When work was over he sat silently, looking upwards. He
      hardly went into the street, spoke only when necessary, and neither joked
      nor laughed. They never saw him smile, except that first evening when
      Matryona gave them supper.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Day by day and week by week the year went round. Michael lived and worked
      with Simon. His fame spread till people said that no one sewed boots so
      neatly and strongly as Simon&rsquo;s workman, Michael; and from all the district
      round people came to Simon for their boots, and he began to be well off.
    </p>
    <p>
      One winter day, as Simon and Michael sat working, a carriage on
      sledge-runners, with three horses and with bells, drove up to the hut.
      They looked out of the window; the carriage stopped at their door, a fine
      servant jumped down from the box and opened the door. A gentleman in a fur
      coat got out and walked up to Simon&rsquo;s hut. Up jumped Matryona and opened
      the door wide. The gentleman stooped to enter the hut, and when he drew
      himself up again his head nearly reached the ceiling, and he seemed quite
      to fill his end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon rose, bowed, and looked at the gentleman with astonishment. He had
      never seen any one like him. Simon himself was lean, Michael was thin, and
      Matryona was dry as a bone, but this man was like some one from another
      world: red-faced, burly, with a neck like a bull&rsquo;s, and looking altogether
      as if he were cast in iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman puffed, threw off his fur coat, sat down on the bench, and
      said, &ldquo;Which of you is the master bootmaker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, your Excellency,&rdquo; said Simon, coming forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the gentleman shouted to his lad, &ldquo;Hey, Fedka, bring the leather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant ran in, bringing a parcel. The gentleman took the parcel and
      put it on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Untie it,&rdquo; said he. The lad untied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman pointed to the leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, shoemaker,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you see this leather?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you know what sort of leather it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon felt the leather and said, &ldquo;It is good leather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, indeed! Why, you fool, you never saw such leather before in your
      life. It&rsquo;s German, and cost twenty roubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon was frightened, and said, &ldquo;Where should I ever see leather like
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so! Now, can you make it into boots for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Excellency, I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the gentleman shouted at him: &ldquo;You can, can you? Well, remember whom
      you are to make them for, and what the leather is. You must make me boots
      that will wear for a year, neither losing shape nor coming unsown. If you
      can do it, take the leather and cut it up; but if you can&rsquo;t, say so. I
      warn you now if your boots become unsewn or lose shape within a year, I
      will have you put in prison. If they don&rsquo;t burst or lose shape for a year
      I will pay you ten roubles for your work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon was frightened, and did not know what to say. He glanced at Michael
      and nudging him with his elbow, whispered: &ldquo;Shall I take the work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael nodded his head as if to say, &ldquo;Yes, take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon did as Michael advised, and undertook to make boots that would not
      lose shape or split for a whole year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calling his servant, the gentleman told him to pull the boot off his left
      leg, which he stretched out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my measure!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon stitched a paper measure seventeen inches long, smoothed it out,
      knelt down, wiped his hand well on his apron so as not to soil the
      gentleman&rsquo;s sock, and began to measure. He measured the sole, and round
      the instep, and began to measure the calf of the leg, but the paper was
      too short. The calf of the leg was as thick as a beam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you don&rsquo;t make it too tight in the leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon stitched on another strip of paper. The gentleman twitched his toes
      about in his sock, looking round at those in the hut, and as he did so he
      noticed Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom have you there?&rdquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my workman. He will sew the boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; said the gentleman to Michael, &ldquo;remember to make them so that they
      will last me a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon also looked at Michael, and saw that Michael was not looking at the
      gentleman, but was gazing into the corner behind the gentleman, as if he
      saw some one there. Michael looked and looked, and suddenly he smiled, and
      his face became brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you grinning at, you fool?&rdquo; thundered the gentleman. &ldquo;You had
      better look to it that the boots are ready in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall be ready in good time,&rdquo; said Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind it is so,&rdquo; said the gentleman, and he put on his boots and his fur
      coat, wrapped the latter round him, and went to the door. But he forgot to
      stoop, and struck his head against the lintel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swore and rubbed his head. Then he took his seat in the carriage and
      drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Simon said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a figure of a man for you! You
      could not kill him with a mallet. He almost knocked out the lintel, but
      little harm it did him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Matryona said: &ldquo;Living as he does, how should he not grow strong?
      Death itself can&rsquo;t touch such a rock as that.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then Simon said to Michael: &ldquo;Well, we have taken the work, but we must see
      we don&rsquo;t get into trouble over it. The leather is dear, and the gentleman
      hot-tempered. We must make no mistakes. Come, your eye is truer and your
      hands have become nimbler than mine, so you take this measure and cut out
      the boots. I will finish off the sewing of the vamps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael did as he was told. He took the leather, spread it out on the
      table, folded it in two, took a knife and began to cut out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matryona came and watched him cutting, and was surprised to see how he was
      doing it. Matryona was accustomed to seeing boots made, and she looked and
      saw that Michael was not cutting the leather for boots, but was cutting it
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wished to say something, but she thought to herself: &ldquo;Perhaps I do not
      understand how gentleman&rsquo;s boots should be made. I suppose Michael knows
      more about it&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Michael had cut up the leather, he took a thread and began to sew not
      with two ends, as boots are sewn, but with a single end, as for soft
      slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Matryona wondered, but again she did not interfere. Michael sewed on
      steadily till noon. Then Simon rose for dinner, looked around, and saw
      that Michael had made slippers out of the gentleman&rsquo;s leather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; groaned Simon, and he thought, &ldquo;How is it that Michael, who has been
      with me a whole year and never made a mistake before, should do such a
      dreadful thing? The gentleman ordered high boots, welted, with whole
      fronts, and Michael has made soft slippers with single soles, and has
      wasted the leather. What am I to say to the gentleman? I can never replace
      leather such as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he said to Michael, &ldquo;What are you doing, friend? You have ruined me!
      You know the gentleman ordered high boots, but see what you have made!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had he begun to rebuke Michael, when &ldquo;rat-tat&rdquo; went the iron ring
      that hung at the door. Some one was knocking. They looked out of the
      window; a man had come on horseback, and was fastening his horse. They
      opened the door, and the servant who had been with the gentleman came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; replied Simon. &ldquo;What can we do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mistress has sent me about the boots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the boots?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my master no longer needs them. He is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not live to get home after leaving you, but died in the carriage.
      When we reached home and the servants came to help him alight, he rolled
      over like a sack. He was dead already, and so stiff that he could hardly
      be got out of the carriage. My mistress sent me here, saying: &lsquo;Tell the
      bootmaker that the gentleman who ordered boots of him and left the leather
      for them no longer needs the boots, but that he must quickly make soft
      slippers for the corpse. Wait till they are ready, and bring them back
      with you.&rsquo; That is why I have come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Michael gathered up the remnants of the leather; rolled them up, took the
      soft slippers he had made, slapped them together, wiped them down with his
      apron, and handed them and the roll of leather to the servant, who took
      them and said: &ldquo;Good-bye, masters, and good day to you!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Another year passed, and another, and Michael was now living his sixth
      year with Simon. He lived as before. He went nowhere, only spoke when
      necessary, and had only smiled twice in all those years&mdash;once when
      Matryona gave him food, and a second time when the gentleman was in their
      hut. Simon was more than pleased with his workman. He never now asked him
      where he came from, and only feared lest Michael should go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all at home one day. Matryona was putting iron pots in the oven;
      the children were running along the benches and looking out of the window;
      Simon was sewing at one window, and Michael was fastening on a heel at the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the boys ran along the bench to Michael, leant on his shoulder, and
      looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, Uncle Michael! There is a lady with little girls! She seems to be
      coming here. And one of the girls is lame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the boy said that, Michael dropped his work, turned to the window,
      and looked out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon was surprised. Michael never used to look out into the street, but
      now he pressed against the window, staring at something. Simon also looked
      out, and saw that a well-dressed woman was really coming to his hut,
      leading by the hand two little girls in fur coats and woolen shawls. The
      girls could hardly be told one from the other, except that one of them was
      crippled in her left leg and walked with a limp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman stepped into the porch and entered the passage. Feeling about
      for the entrance she found the latch, which she lifted, and opened the
      door. She let the two girls go in first, and followed them into the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day, good folk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray come in,&rdquo; said Simon. &ldquo;What can we do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman sat down by the table. The two little girls pressed close to her
      knees, afraid of the people in the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want leather shoes made for these two little girls for spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can do that. We never have made such small shoes, but we can make
      them; either welted or turnover shoes, linen lined. My man, Michael, is a
      master at the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon glanced at Michael and saw that he had left his work and was sitting
      with his eyes fixed on the little girls. Simon was surprised. It was true
      the girls were pretty, with black eyes, plump, and rosy-cheeked, and they
      wore nice kerchiefs and fur coats, but still Simon could not understand
      why Michael should look at them like that&mdash;just as if he had known
      them before. He was puzzled, but went on talking with the woman, and
      arranging the price. Having fixed it, he prepared the measure. The woman
      lifted the lame girl on to her lap and said: &ldquo;Take two measures from this
      little girl. Make one shoe for the lame foot and three for the sound one.
      They both have the same size feet. They are twins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simon took the measure and, speaking of the lame girl, said: &ldquo;How did it
      happen to her? She is such a pretty girl. Was she born so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, her mother crushed her leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Matryona joined in. She wondered who this woman was, and whose the
      children were, so she said: &ldquo;Are not you their mother then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my good woman; I am neither their mother nor any relation to them.
      They were quite strangers to me, but I adopted them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not your children and yet you are so fond of them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help being fond of them? I fed them both at my own breasts. I
      had a child of my own, but God took him. I was not so fond of him as I now
      am of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then whose children are they?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The woman, having begun talking, told them the whole story.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is about six years since their parents died, both in one week: their
      father was buried on the Tuesday, and their mother died on the Friday.
      These orphans were born three days after their father&rsquo;s death, and their
      mother did not live another day. My husband and I were then living as
      peasants in the village. We were neighbors of theirs, our yard being next
      to theirs. Their father was a lonely man; a wood-cutter in the forest.
      When felling trees one day, they let one fall on him. It fell across his
      body and crushed his bowels out. They hardly got him home before his soul
      went to God; and that same week his wife gave birth to twins&mdash;these
      little girls. She was poor and alone; she had no one, young or old, with
      her. Alone she gave them birth, and alone she met her death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next morning I went to see her, but when I entered the hut, she, poor
      thing, was already stark and cold. In dying she had rolled on to this
      child and crushed her leg. The village folk came to the hut, washed the
      body, laid her out, made a coffin, and buried her. They were good folk.
      The babies were left alone. What was to be done with them? I was the only
      woman there who had a baby at the time. I was nursing my first-born&mdash;eight
      weeks old. So I took them for a time. The peasants came together, and
      thought and thought what to do with them; and at last they said to me:
      &lsquo;For the present, Mary, you had better keep the girls, and later on we
      will arrange what to do for them.&rsquo; So I nursed the sound one at my breast,
      but at first I did not feed this crippled one. I did not suppose she would
      live. But then I thought to myself, why should the poor innocent suffer? I
      pitied her, and began to feed her. And so I fed my own boy and these two&mdash;the
      three of them&mdash;at my own breast. I was young and strong, and had good
      food, and God gave me so much milk that at times it even overflowed. I
      used sometimes to feed two at a time, while the third was waiting. When
      one had enough I nursed the third. And God so ordered it that these grew
      up, while my own was buried before he was two years old. And I had no more
      children, though we prospered. Now my husband is working for the corn
      merchant at the mill. The pay is good, and we are well off. But I have no
      children of my own, and how lonely I should be without these little girls!
      How can I help loving them! They are the joy of my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed the lame little girl to her with one hand, while with the
      other she wiped the tears from her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Matryona sighed, and said: &ldquo;The proverb is true that says, &lsquo;One may
      live without father or mother, but one cannot live without God.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they talked together, when suddenly the whole hut was lighted up as
      though by summer lightning from the corner where Michael sat. They all
      looked towards him and saw him sitting, his hands folded on his knees,
      gazing upwards and smiling.

    <h2>
      X
    </h2>
    <p>
      The woman went away with the girls. Michael rose from the bench, put down
      his work, and took off his apron. Then, bowing low to Simon and his wife,
      he said: &ldquo;Farewell, masters. God has forgiven me. I ask your forgiveness,
      too, for anything done amiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they saw that a light shone from Michael. And Simon rose, bowed down
      to Michael, and said: &ldquo;I see, Michael, that you are no common man, and I
      can neither keep you nor question you. Only tell me this: how is it that
      when I found you and brought you home, you were gloomy, and when my wife
      gave you food you smiled at her and became brighter? Then when the
      gentleman came to order the boots, you smiled again and became brighter
      still? And now, when this woman brought the little girls, you smiled a
      third time, and have become as bright as day? Tell me, Michael, why does
      your face shine so, and why did you smile those three times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Michael answered: &ldquo;Light shines from me because I have been punished,
      but now God has pardoned me. And I smiled three times, because God sent me
      to learn three truths, and I have learnt them. One I learnt when your wife
      pitied me, and that is why I smiled the first time. The second I learnt
      when the rich man ordered the boots, and then I smiled again. And now,
      when I saw those little girls, I learn the third and last truth, and I
      smiled the third time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Simon said, &ldquo;Tell me, Michael, what did God punish you for? and what
      were the three truths? that I, too, may know them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Michael answered: &ldquo;God punished me for disobeying Him. I was an angel
      in heaven and disobeyed God. God sent me to fetch a woman&rsquo;s soul. I flew
      to earth, and saw a sick woman lying alone, who had just given birth to
      twin girls. They moved feebly at their mother&rsquo;s side, but she could not
      lift them to her breast. When she saw me, she understood that God had sent
      me for her soul, and she wept and said: &lsquo;Angel of God! My husband has just
      been buried, killed by a falling tree. I have neither sister, nor aunt,
      nor mother: no one to care for my orphans. Do not take my soul! Let me
      nurse my babes, feed them, and set them on their feet before I die.
      Children cannot live without father or mother.&rsquo; And I hearkened to her. I
      placed one child at her breast and gave the other into her arms, and
      returned to the Lord in heaven. I flew to the Lord, and said: &lsquo;I could not
      take the soul of the mother. Her husband was killed by a tree; the woman
      has twins, and prays that her soul may not be taken. She says: &ldquo;Let me
      nurse and feed my children, and set them on their feet. Children cannot
      live without father or mother.&rdquo; I have not taken her soul.&rsquo; And God said:
      &lsquo;Go-take the mother&rsquo;s soul, and learn three truths: Learn What dwells in
      man, What is not given to man, and What men live by. When thou has learnt
      these things, thou shalt return to heaven.&rsquo; So I flew again to earth and
      took the mother&rsquo;s soul. The babes dropped from her breasts. Her body
      rolled over on the bed and crushed one babe, twisting its leg. I rose
      above the village, wishing to take her soul to God; but a wind seized me,
      and my wings drooped and dropped off. Her soul rose alone to God, while I
      fell to earth by the roadside.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      And Simon and Matryona understood who it was that had lived with them, and
      whom they had clothed and fed. And they wept with awe and with joy. And
      the angel said: &ldquo;I was alone in the field, naked. I had never known human
      needs, cold and hunger, till I became a man. I was famished, frozen, and
      did not know what to do. I saw, near the field I was in, a shrine built
      for God, and I went to it hoping to find shelter. But the shrine was
      locked, and I could not enter. So I sat down behind the shrine to shelter
      myself at least from the wind. Evening drew on. I was hungry, frozen, and
      in pain. Suddenly I heard a man coming along the road. He carried a pair
      of boots, and was talking to himself. For the first time since I became a
      man I saw the mortal face of a man, and his face seemed terrible to me and
      I turned from it. And I heard the man talking to himself of how to cover
      his body from the cold in winter, and how to feed wife and children. And I
      thought: &lsquo;I am perishing of cold and hunger, and here is a man thinking
      only of how to clothe himself and his wife, and how to get bread for
      themselves. He cannot help me.&rsquo; When the man saw me he frowned and became
      still more terrible, and passed me by on the other side. I despaired; but
      suddenly I heard him coming back. I looked up, and did not recognize the
      same man; before, I had seen death in his face; but now he was alive, and
      I recognized in him the presence of God. He came up to me, clothed me,
      took me with him, and brought me to his home. I entered the house; a woman
      came to meet us and began to speak. The woman was still more terrible than
      the man had been; the spirit of death came from her mouth; I could not
      breathe for the stench of death that spread around her. She wished to
      drive me out into the cold, and I knew that if she did so she would die.
      Suddenly her husband spoke to her of God, and the woman changed at once.
      And when she brought me food and looked at me, I glanced at her and saw
      that death no longer dwelt in her; she had become alive, and in her, too,
      I saw God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I remembered the first lesson God had set me: &lsquo;Learn what dwells in
      man.&rsquo; And I understood that in man dwells Love! I was glad that God had
      already begun to show me what He had promised, and I smiled for the first
      time. But I had not yet learnt all. I did not yet know What is not given
      to man, and What men live by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lived with you, and a year passed. A man came to order boots that
      should wear for a year without losing shape or cracking. I looked at him,
      and suddenly, behind his shoulder, I saw my comrade&mdash;the angel of
      death. None but me saw that angel; but I knew him, and knew that before
      the sun set he would take that rich man&rsquo;s soul. And I thought to myself,
      &lsquo;The man is making preparations for a year, and does not know that he will
      die before evening.&rsquo; And I remembered God&rsquo;s second saying, &lsquo;Learn what is
      not given to man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What dwells in man I already knew. Now I learnt what is not given him. It
      is not given to man to know his own needs. And I smiled for the second
      time. I was glad to have seen my comrade angel&mdash;glad also that God
      had revealed to me the second saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I still did not know all. I did not know What men live by. And I
      lived on, waiting till God should reveal to me the last lesson. In the
      sixth year came the girl-twins with the woman; and I recognized the girls,
      and heard how they had been kept alive. Having heard the story, I thought,
      &lsquo;Their mother besought me for the children&rsquo;s sake, and I believed her when
      she said that children cannot live without father or mother; but a
      stranger has nursed them, and has brought them up.&rsquo; And when the woman
      showed her love for the children that were not her own, and wept over
      them, I saw in her the living God and understood What men live by. And I
      knew that God had revealed to me the last lesson, and had forgiven my sin.
      And then I smiled for the third time.&rdquo;

    <p>
      And the angel&rsquo;s body was bared, and he was clothed in light so that eye
      could not look on him; and his voice grew louder, as though it came not
      from him but from heaven above. And the angel said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have learnt that all men live not by care for themselves but by love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not given to the mother to know what her children needed for their
      life. Nor was it given to the rich man to know what he himself needed. Nor
      is it given to any man to know whether, when evening comes, he will need
      boots for his body or slippers for his corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remained alive when I was a man, not by care of myself, but because
      love was present in a passer-by, and because he and his wife pitied and
      loved me. The orphans remained alive not because of their mother&rsquo;s care,
      but because there was love in the heart of a woman, a stranger to them,
      who pitied and loved them. And all men live not by the thought they spend
      on their own welfare, but because love exists in man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew before that God gave life to men and desires that they should
      live; now I understood more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood that God does not wish men to live apart, and therefore he
      does not reveal to them what each one needs for himself; but he wishes
      them to live united, and therefore reveals to each of them what is
      necessary for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have now understood that though it seems to men that they live by care
      for themselves, in truth it is love alone by which they live. He who has
      love, is in God, and God is in him, for God is love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the angel sang praise to God, so that the hut trembled at his voice.
      The roof opened, and a column of fire rose from earth to heaven. Simon and
      his wife and children fell to the ground. Wings appeared upon the angel&rsquo;s
      shoulders, and he rose into the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Simon came to himself the hut stood as before, and there was no
      one in it but his own family.

      THREE QUESTIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It once occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right time
      to begin everything; if he knew who were the right people to listen to,
      and whom to avoid; and, above all, if he always knew what was the most
      important thing to do, he would never fail in anything he might undertake.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this thought having occurred to him, he had it proclaimed throughout
      his kingdom that he would give a great reward to any one who would teach
      him what was the right time for every action, and who were the most
      necessary people, and how he might know what was the most important thing
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      And learned men came to the King, but they all answered his questions
      differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to the first question, some said that to know the right time for
      every action, one must draw up in advance, a table of days, months and
      years, and must live strictly according to it. Only thus, said they, could
      everything be done at its proper time. Others declared that it was
      impossible to decide beforehand the right time for every action; but that,
      not letting oneself be absorbed in idle pastimes, one should always attend
      to all that was going on, and then do what was most needful. Others,
      again, said that however attentive the King might be to what was going on,
      it was impossible for one man to decide correctly the right time for every
      action, but that he should have a Council of wise men, who would help him
      to fix the proper time for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then again others said there were some things which could not wait to
      be laid before a Council, but about which one had at once to decide
      whether to undertake them or not. But in order to decide that, one must
      know beforehand what was going to happen. It is only magicians who know
      that; and, therefore, in order to know the right time for every action,
      one must consult magicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally various were the answers to the second question. Some said, the
      people the King most needed were his councillors; others, the priests;
      others, the doctors; while some said the warriors were the most necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the third question, as to what was the most important occupation: some
      replied that the most important thing in the world was science. Others
      said it was skill in warfare; and others, again, that it was religious
      worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the answers being different, the King agreed with none of them, and
      gave the reward to none. But still wishing to find the right answers to
      his questions, he decided to consult a hermit, widely renowned for his
      wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hermit lived in a wood which he never quitted, and he received none
      but common folk. So the King put on simple clothes, and before reaching
      the hermit&rsquo;s cell dismounted from his horse, and, leaving his body-guard
      behind, went on alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front of
      his hut. Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on digging. The hermit
      was frail and weak, and each time he stuck his spade into the ground and
      turned a little earth, he breathed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King went up to him and said: &ldquo;I have come to you, wise hermit, to ask
      you to answer three questions: How can I learn to do the right thing at
      the right time? Who are the people I most need, and to whom should I,
      therefore, pay more attention than to the rest? And, what affairs are the
      most important, and need my first attention?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing. He just spat on his
      hand and recommenced digging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;let me take the spade and work awhile for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks!&rdquo; said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King, he sat down
      on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had dug two beds, the King stopped and repeated his questions. The
      hermit again gave no answer, but rose, stretched out his hand for the
      spade, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now rest awhile-and let me work a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the King did not give him the spade, and continued to dig. One hour
      passed, and another. The sun began to sink behind the trees, and the King
      at last stuck the spade into the ground, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If you can give
      me none, tell me so, and I will return home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes some one running,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;let us see who it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the wood.
      The man held his hands pressed against his stomach, and blood was flowing
      from under them. When he reached the King, he fell fainting on the ground
      moaning feebly. The King and the hermit unfastened the man&rsquo;s clothing.
      There was a large wound in his stomach. The King washed it as best he
      could, and bandaged it with his handkerchief and with a towel the hermit
      had. But the blood would not stop flowing, and the King again and again
      removed the bandage soaked with warm blood, and washed and rebandaged the
      wound. When at last the blood ceased flowing, the man revived and asked
      for something to drink. The King brought fresh water and gave it to him.
      Meanwhile the sun had set, and it had become cool. So the King, with the
      hermit&rsquo;s help, carried the wounded man into the hut and laid him on the
      bed. Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes and was quiet; but the King
      was so tired with his walk and with the work he had done, that he crouched
      down on the threshold, and also fell asleep&mdash;so soundly that he slept
      all through the short summer night. When he awoke in the morning, it was
      long before he could remember where he was, or who was the strange bearded
      man lying on the bed and gazing intently at him with shining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw that the
      King was awake and was looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for,&rdquo; said the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who swore to
      revenge himself on you, because you executed his brother and seized his
      property. I knew you had gone alone to see the hermit, and I resolved to
      kill you on your way back. But the day passed and you did not return. So I
      came out from my ambush to find you, and I came upon your bodyguard, and
      they recognized me, and wounded me. I escaped from them, but should have
      bled to death had you not dressed my wound. I wished to kill you, and you
      have saved my life. Now, if I live, and if you wish it, I will serve you
      as your most faithful slave, and will bid my sons do the same. Forgive
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily, and to
      have gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him, but said he
      would send his servants and his own physician to attend him, and promised
      to restore his property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the porch
      and looked around for the hermit. Before going away he wished once more to
      beg an answer to the questions he had put. The hermit was outside, on his
      knees, sowing seeds in the beds that had been dug the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King approached him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the last time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have already been answered!&rdquo; said the hermit, still crouching on his
      thin legs, and looking up at the King, who stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How answered? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see,&rdquo; replied the hermit. &ldquo;If you had not pitied my weakness
      yesterday, and had not dug those beds for me, but had gone your way, that
      man would have attacked you, and you would have repented of not having
      stayed with me. So the most important time was when you were digging the
      beds; and I was the most important man; and to do me good was your most
      important business. Afterwards when that man ran to us, the most important
      time was when you were attending to him, for if you had not bound up his
      wounds he would have died without having made peace with you. So he was
      the most important man, and what you did for him was your most important
      business. Remember then: there is only one time that is important&mdash;Now!
      It is the most important time because it is the only time when we have any
      power. The most necessary man is he with whom you are, for no man knows
      whether he will ever have dealings with any one else: and the most
      important affair is, to do him good, because for that purpose alone was
      man sent into this life!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE COFFEE-HOUSE OF SURAT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      (After Bernardin de Saint-Pierre)
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the town of Surat, in India, was a coffee-house where many travellers
      and foreigners from all parts of the world met and conversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a learned Persian theologian visited this coffee-house. He was a
      man who had spent his life studying the nature of the Deity, and reading
      and writing books upon the subject. He had thought, read, and written so
      much about God, that eventually he lost his wits, became quite confused,
      and ceased even to believe in the existence of a God. The Shah, hearing of
      this, had banished him from Persia.
    </p>
    <p>
      After having argued all his life about the First Cause, this unfortunate
      theologian had ended by quite perplexing himself, and instead of
      understanding that he had lost his own reason, he began to think that
      there was no higher Reason controlling the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man had an African slave who followed him everywhere. When the
      theologian entered the coffee-house, the slave remained outside, near the
      door, sitting on a stone in the glare of the sun, and driving away the
      flies that buzzed around him. The Persian having settled down on a divan
      in the coffee-house, ordered himself a cup of opium. When he had drunk it
      and the opium had begun to quicken the workings of his brain, he addressed
      his slave through the open door:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, wretched slave,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you think there is a God, or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course there is,&rdquo; said the slave, and immediately drew from under his
      girdle a small idol of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is the God who has guarded me from the day of my
      birth. Every one in our country worships the fetish tree, from the wood of
      which this God was made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This conversation between the theologian and his slave was listened to
      with surprise by the other guests in the coffee-house. They were
      astonished at the master&rsquo;s question, and yet more so at the slave&rsquo;s reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them, a Brahmin, on hearing the words spoken by the slave, turned
      to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserable fool! Is it possible you believe that God can be carried under
      a man&rsquo;s girdle? There is one God&mdash;Brahma, and he is greater than the
      whole world, for he created it. Brahma is the One, the mighty God, and in
      His honour are built the temples on the Ganges&rsquo; banks, where his true
      priests, the Brahmins, worship him. They know the true God, and none but
      they. A thousand score of years have passed, and yet through revolution
      after revolution these priests have held their sway, because Brahma, the
      one true God, has protected them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So spoke the Brahmin, thinking to convince every one; but a Jewish broker
      who was present replied to him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! the temple of the true God is not in India. Neither does God protect
      the Brahmin caste. The true God is not the God of the Brahmins, but of
      Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. None does He protect but His chosen people, the
      Israelites. From the commencement of the world, our nation has been
      beloved of Him, and ours alone. If we are now scattered over the whole
      earth, it is but to try us; for God has promised that He will one day
      gather His people together in Jerusalem. Then, with the Temple of
      Jerusalem&mdash;the wonder of the ancient world&mdash;restored to its
      splendor, shall Israel be established a ruler over all nations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So spoke the Jew, and burst into tears. He wished to say more, but an
      Italian missionary who was there interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you are saying is untrue,&rdquo; said he to the Jew. &ldquo;You attribute
      injustice to God. He cannot love your nation above the rest. Nay rather,
      even if it be true that of old He favored the Israelites, it is now
      nineteen hundred years since they angered Him, and caused Him to destroy
      their nation and scatter them over the earth, so that their faith makes no
      converts and has died out except here and there. God shows preference to
      no nation, but calls all who wish to be saved to the bosom of the Catholic
      Church of Rome, the one outside whose borders no salvation can be found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So spoke the Italian. But a Protestant minister, who happened to be
      present, growing pale, turned to the Catholic missionary and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say that salvation belongs to your religion? Those only will
      be saved, who serve God according to the Gospel, in spirit and in truth,
      as bidden by the word of Christ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a Turk, an office-holder in the custom-house at Surat, who was
      sitting in the coffee-house smoking a pipe, turned with an air of
      superiority to both the Christians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your belief in your Roman religion is vain,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It was superseded
      twelve hundred years ago by the true faith: that of Mohammed! You cannot
      but observe how the true Mohammed faith continues to spread both in Europe
      and Asia, and even in the enlightened country of China. You say yourselves
      that God has rejected the Jews; and, as a proof, you quote the fact that
      the Jews are humiliated and their faith does not spread. Confess then the
      truth of Mohammedanism, for it is triumphant and spreads far and wide.
      None will be saved but the followers of Mohammed, God&rsquo;s latest prophet;
      and of them, only the followers of Omar, and not of Ali, for the latter
      are false to the faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this the Persian theologian, who was of the sect of Ali, wished to
      reply; but by this time a great dispute had arisen among all the strangers
      of different faiths and creeds present. There were Abyssinian Christians,
      Llamas from Thibet, Ismailians and Fireworshippers. They all argued about
      the nature of God, and how He should be worshipped. Each of them asserted
      that in his country alone was the true God known and rightly worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one argued and shouted, except a Chinaman, a student of Confucius,
      who sat quietly in one corner of the coffee-house, not joining in the
      dispute. He sat there drinking tea and listening to what the others said,
      but did not speak himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Turk noticed him sitting there, and appealed to him, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can confirm what I say, my good Chinaman. You hold your peace, but if
      you spoke I know you would uphold my opinion. Traders from your country,
      who come to me for assistance, tell me that though many religions have
      been introduced into China, you Chinese consider Mohammedanism the best of
      all, and adopt it willingly. Confirm, then, my words, and tell us your
      opinion of the true God and of His prophet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the rest, turning to the Chinaman, &ldquo;let us hear what you
      think on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chinaman, the student of Confucius, closed his eyes, and thought a
      while. Then he opened them again, and drawing his hands out of the wide
      sleeves of his garment, and folding them on his breast, he spoke as
      follows, in a calm and quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sirs, it seems to me that it is chiefly pride that prevents men agreeing
      with one another on matters of faith. If you care to listen to me, I will
      tell you a story which will explain this by an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came here from China on an English steamer which had been round the
      world. We stopped for fresh water, and landed on the east coast of the
      island of Sumatra. It was midday, and some of us, having landed, sat in
      the shade of some cocoanut palms by the seashore, not far from a native
      village. We were a party of men of different nationalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we sat there, a blind man approached us. We learned afterwards that he
      had gone blind from gazing too long and too persistently at the sun,
      trying to find out what it is, in order to seize its light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He strove a long time to accomplish this, constantly looking at the sun;
      but the only result was that his eyes were injured by its brightness, and
      he became blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The light of the sun is not a liquid; for if it were a liquid it would be
      possible to pour it from one vessel into another, and it would be moved,
      like water, by the wind. Neither is it fire; for if it were fire, water
      would extinguish it. Neither is light a spirit, for it is seen by the eye;
      nor is it matter, for it cannot be moved. Therefore, as the light of the
      sun is neither liquid, nor fire, nor spirit, nor matter, it is&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he argued, and, as a result of always looking at the sun and always
      thinking about it, he lost both his sight and his reason. And when he went
      quite blind, he became fully convinced that the sun did not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this blind man came a slave, who after placing his master in the
      shade of a cocoanut tree, picked up a cocoanut from the ground, and began
      making it into a night-light. He twisted a wick from the fibre of the
      cocoanut: squeezed oil from the nut in the shell, and soaked the wick in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the slave sat doing this, the blind man sighed and said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, slave, was I not right when I told you there is no sun? Do you not
      see how dark it is? Yet people say there is a sun.... But if so, what is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what the sun is,&rdquo; said the slave. &ldquo;That is no business of
      mine. But I know what light is. Here I have made a night-light, by the
      help of which I can serve you and find anything I want in the hut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the slave picked up the cocoanut shell, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A lame man with crutches, who was sitting near by, heard these words, and
      laughed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have evidently been blind all your life,&rdquo; said he to the blind man,
      &ldquo;not to know what the sun is. I will tell you what it is. The sun is a
      ball of fire, which rises every morning out of the sea and goes down again
      among the mountains of our island each evening. We have all seen this, and
      if you had had your eyesight you too would have seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fisherman, who had been listening to the conversation said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is plain enough that you have never been beyond your own island. If
      you were not lame, and if you had been out as I have in a fishing-boat,
      you would know that the sun does not set among the mountains of our
      island, but as it rises from the ocean every morning so it sets again in
      the sea every night. What I am telling you is true, for I see it every day
      with my own eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then an Indian who was of our party, interrupted him by saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am astonished that a reasonable man should talk such nonsense. How can
      a ball of fire possibly descend into the water and not be extinguished?
      The sun is not a ball of fire at all, it is the Deity named Deva, who
      rides for ever in a chariot round the golden mountain, Meru. Sometimes the
      evil serpents Ragu and Ketu attack Deva and swallow him: and then the
      earth is dark. But our priests pray that the Deity may be released, and
      then he is set free. Only such ignorant men as you, who have never been
      beyond their own island, can imagine that the sun shines for their country
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the master of an Egyptian vessel, who was present, spoke in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you also are wrong. The sun is not a Deity, and does not
      move only round India and its golden mountain. I have sailed much on the
      Black Sea, and along the coasts of Arabia, and have been to Madagascar and
      to the Philippines. The sun lights the whole earth, and not India alone.
      It does not circle round one mountain, but rises far in the East, beyond
      the Isles of Japan, and sets far, far away in the West, beyond the islands
      of England. That is why the Japanese call their country &lsquo;Nippon,&rsquo; that is,
      &lsquo;the birth of the sun.&rsquo; I know this well, for I have myself seen much, and
      heard more from my grandfather, who sailed to the very ends of the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have gone on, but an English sailor from our ship interrupted
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no country,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;where people know so much about the sun&rsquo;s
      movements as in England. The sun, as every one in England knows, rises
      nowhere and sets nowhere. It is always moving round the earth. We can be
      sure of this for we have just been round the world ourselves, and nowhere
      knocked up against the sun. Wherever we went, the sun showed itself in the
      morning and hid itself at night, just as it does here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Englishman took a stick and, drawing circles on the sand, tried to
      explain how the sun moves in the heavens and goes round the world. But he
      was unable to explain it clearly, and pointing to the ship&rsquo;s pilot said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This man knows more about it than I do. He can explain it properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pilot, who was an intelligent man, had listened in silence to the talk
      till he was asked to speak. Now every one turned to him, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are all misleading one another, and are yourselves deceived. The sun
      does not go round the earth, but the earth goes round the sun, revolving
      as it goes, and turning towards the sun in the course of each twenty-four
      hours, not only Japan, and the Philippines, and Sumatra where we now are,
      but Africa, and Europe, and America, and many lands besides. The sun does
      not shine for some one mountain, or for some one island, or for some one
      sea, nor even for one earth alone, but for other planets as well as our
      earth. If you would only look up at the heavens, instead of at the ground
      beneath your own feet, you might all understand this, and would then no
      longer suppose that the sun shines for you, or for your country alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus spoke the wise pilot, who had voyaged much about the world, and had
      gazed much upon the heavens above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So on matters of faith,&rdquo; continued the Chinaman, the student of
      Confucius, &ldquo;it is pride that causes error and discord among men. As with
      the sun, so it is with God. Each man wants to have a special God of his
      own, or at least a special God for his native land. Each nation wishes to
      confine in its own temples Him, whom the world cannot contain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can any temple compare with that which God Himself has built to unite all
      men in one faith and one religion?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All human temples are built on the model of this temple, which is God&rsquo;s
      own world. Every temple has its fonts, its vaulted roof, its lamps, its
      pictures or sculptures, its inscriptions, its books of the law, its
      offerings, its altars and its priests. But in what temple is there such a
      font as the ocean; such a vault as that of the heavens; such lamps as the
      sun, moon, and stars; or any figures to be compared with living, loving,
      mutually-helpful men? Where are there any records of God&rsquo;s goodness so
      easy to understand as the blessings which God has strewn abroad for man&rsquo;s
      happiness? Where is there any book of the law so clear to each man as that
      written in his heart? What sacrifices equal the self-denials which loving
      men and women make for one another? And what altar can be compared with
      the heart of a good man, on which God Himself accepts the sacrifice?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The higher a man&rsquo;s conception of God, the better will he know Him. And
      the better he knows God, the nearer will he draw to Him, imitating His
      goodness, His mercy, and His love of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore, let him who sees the sun&rsquo;s whole light filling the world,
      refrain from blaming or despising the superstitious man, who in his own
      idol sees one ray of that same light. Let him not despise even the
      unbeliever who is blind and cannot see the sun at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So spoke the Chinaman, the student of Confucius; and all who were present
      in the coffee-house were silent, and disputed no more as to whose faith
      was the best.

    <p>
      An elder sister came to visit her younger sister in the country. The elder
      was married to a tradesman in town, the younger to a peasant in the
      village. As the sisters sat over their tea talking, the elder began to
      boast of the advantages of town life: saying how comfortably they lived
      there, how well they dressed, what fine clothes her children wore, what
      good things they ate and drank, and how she went to the theatre,
      promenades, and entertainments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger sister was piqued, and in turn disparaged the life of a
      tradesman, and stood up for that of a peasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not change my way of life for yours,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;We may live
      roughly, but at least we are free from anxiety. You live in better style
      than we do, but though you often earn more than you need, you are very
      likely to lose all you have. You know the proverb, &lsquo;Loss and gain are
      brothers twain.&rsquo; It often happens that people who are wealthy one day are
      begging their bread the next. Our way is safer. Though a peasant&rsquo;s life is
      not a fat one, it is a long one. We shall never grow rich, but we shall
      always have enough to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elder sister said sneeringly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough? Yes, if you like to share with the pigs and the calves! What do
      you know of elegance or manners! However much your good man may slave, you
      will die as you are living-on a dung heap-and your children the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo; replied the younger. &ldquo;Of course our work is rough
      and coarse. But, on the other hand, it is sure; and we need not bow to any
      one. But you, in your towns, are surrounded by temptations; today all may
      be right, but tomorrow the Evil One may tempt your husband with cards,
      wine, or women, and all will go to ruin. Don&rsquo;t such things happen often
      enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pahom, the master of the house, was lying on the top of the oven, and he
      listened to the women&rsquo;s chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly true,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;Busy as we are from childhood tilling
      Mother Earth, we peasants have no time to let any nonsense settle in our
      heads. Our only trouble is that we haven&rsquo;t land enough. If I had plenty of
      land, I shouldn&rsquo;t fear the Devil himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The women finished their tea, chatted a while about dress, and then
      cleared away the tea-things and lay down to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Devil had been sitting behind the oven, and had heard all that was
      said. He was pleased that the peasant&rsquo;s wife had led her husband into
      boasting, and that he had said that if he had plenty of land he would not
      fear the Devil himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; thought the Devil. &ldquo;We will have a tussle. I&rsquo;ll give you land
      enough; and by means of that land I will get you into my power.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Close to the village there lived a lady, a small landowner, who had an
      estate of about three hundred acres. She had always lived on good terms
      with the peasants, until she engaged as her steward an old soldier, who
      took to burdening the people with fines. However careful Pahom tried to
      be, it happened again and again that now a horse of his got among the
      lady&rsquo;s oats, now a cow strayed into her garden, now his calves found their
      way into her meadows-and he always had to pay a fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pahom paid, but grumbled, and, going home in a temper, was rough with his
      family. All through that summer Pahom had much trouble because of this
      steward; and he was even glad when winter came and the cattle had to be
      stabled. Though he grudged the fodder when they could no longer graze on
      the pasture-land, at least he was free from anxiety about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the winter the news got about that the lady was going to sell her land,
      and that the keeper of the inn on the high road was bargaining for it.
      When the peasants heard this they were very much alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought they, &ldquo;if the innkeeper gets the land he will worry us
      with fines worse than the lady&rsquo;s steward. We all depend on that estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the peasants went on behalf of their Commune, and asked the lady not to
      sell the land to the innkeeper; offering her a better price for it
      themselves. The lady agreed to let them have it. Then the peasants tried
      to arrange for the Commune to buy the whole estate, so that it might be
      held by all in common. They met twice to discuss it, but could not settle
      the matter; the Evil One sowed discord among them, and they could not
      agree. So they decided to buy the land individually, each according to his
      means; and the lady agreed to this plan as she had to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Pahom heard that a neighbor of his was buying fifty acres, and
      that the lady had consented to accept one half in cash and to wait a year
      for the other half. Pahom felt envious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;the land is all being sold, and I shall get
      none of it.&rdquo; So he spoke to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other people are buying,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and we must also buy twenty acres or
      so. Life is becoming impossible. That steward is simply crushing us with
      his fines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they put their heads together and considered how they could manage to
      buy it. They had one hundred roubles laid by. They sold a colt, and one
      half of their bees; hired out one of their sons as a laborer, and took his
      wages in advance; borrowed the rest from a brother-in-law, and so scraped
      together half the purchase money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having done this, Pahom chose out a farm of forty acres, some of it
      wooded, and went to the lady to bargain for it. They came to an agreement,
      and he shook hands with her upon it, and paid her a deposit in advance.
      Then they went to town and signed the deeds; he paying half the price
      down, and undertaking to pay the remainder within two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now Pahom had land of his own. He borrowed seed, and sowed it on the
      land he had bought. The harvest was a good one, and within a year he had
      managed to pay off his debts both to the lady and to his brother-in-law.
      So he became a landowner, ploughing and sowing his own land, making hay on
      his own land, cutting his own trees, and feeding his cattle on his own
      pasture. When he went out to plough his fields, or to look at his growing
      corn, or at his grass meadows, his heart would fill with joy. The grass
      that grew and the flowers that bloomed there, seemed to him unlike any
      that grew elsewhere. Formerly, when he had passed by that land, it had
      appeared the same as any other land, but now it seemed quite different.

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      So Pahom was well contented, and everything would have been right if the
      neighboring peasants would only not have trespassed on his corn-fields and
      meadows. He appealed to them most civilly, but they still went on: now the
      Communal herdsmen would let the village cows stray into his meadows; then
      horses from the night pasture would get among his corn. Pahom turned them
      out again and again, and forgave their owners, and for a long time he
      forbore from prosecuting any one. But at last he lost patience and
      complained to the District Court. He knew it was the peasants&rsquo; want of
      land, and no evil intent on their part, that caused the trouble; but he
      thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot go on overlooking it, or they will destroy all I have. They must
      be taught a lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he had them up, gave them one lesson, and then another, and two or
      three of the peasants were fined. After a time Pahom&rsquo;s neighbours began to
      bear him a grudge for this, and would now and then let their cattle on his
      land on purpose. One peasant even got into Pahom&rsquo;s wood at night and cut
      down five young lime trees for their bark. Pahom passing through the wood
      one day noticed something white. He came nearer, and saw the stripped
      trunks lying on the ground, and close by stood the stumps, where the tree
      had been. Pahom was furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he had only cut one here and there it would have been bad enough,&rdquo;
       thought Pahom, &ldquo;but the rascal has actually cut down a whole clump. If I
      could only find out who did this, I would pay him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He racked his brains as to who it could be. Finally he decided: &ldquo;It must
      be Simon-no one else could have done it.&rdquo; Se he went to Simon&rsquo;s homestead
      to have a look around, but he found nothing, and only had an angry scene.
      However&rsquo; he now felt more certain than ever that Simon had done it, and he
      lodged a complaint. Simon was summoned. The case was tried, and re-tried,
      and at the end of it all Simon was acquitted, there being no evidence
      against him. Pahom felt still more aggrieved, and let his anger loose upon
      the Elder and the Judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let thieves grease your palms,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If you were honest folk
      yourselves, you would not let a thief go free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Pahom quarrelled with the Judges and with his neighbors. Threats to
      burn his building began to be uttered. So though Pahom had more land, his
      place in the Commune was much worse than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time a rumor got about that many people were moving to new
      parts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for me to leave my land,&rdquo; thought Pahom. &ldquo;But some of the
      others might leave our village, and then there would be more room for us.
      I would take over their land myself, and make my estate a bit bigger. I
      could then live more at ease. As it is, I am still too cramped to be
      comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One day Pahom was sitting at home, when a peasant passing through the
      village, happened to call in. He was allowed to stay the night, and supper
      was given him. Pahom had a talk with this peasant and asked him where he
      came from. The stranger answered that he came from beyond the Volga, where
      he had been working. One word led to another, and the man went on to say
      that many people were settling in those parts. He told how some people
      from his village had settled there. They had joined the Commune, and had
      had twenty-five acres per man granted them. The land was so good, he said,
      that the rye sown on it grew as high as a horse, and so thick that five
      cuts of a sickle made a sheaf. One peasant, he said, had brought nothing
      with him but his bare hands, and now he had six horses and two cows of his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pahom&rsquo;s heart kindled with desire. He thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I suffer in this narrow hole, if one can live so well
      elsewhere? I will sell my land and my homestead here, and with the money I
      will start afresh over there and get everything new. In this crowded place
      one is always having trouble. But I must first go and find out all about
      it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Towards summer he got ready and started. He went down the Volga on a
      steamer to Samara, then walked another three hundred miles on foot, and at
      last reached the place. It was just as the stranger had said. The peasants
      had plenty of land: every man had twenty-five acres of Communal land given
      him for his use, and any one who had money could buy, besides, at
      fifty-cents an acre as much good freehold land as he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having found out all he wished to know, Pahom returned home as autumn came
      on, and began selling off his belongings. He sold his land at a profit,
      sold his homestead and all his cattle, and withdrew from membership of the
      Commune. He only waited till the spring, and then started with his family
      for the new settlement.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as Pahom and his family arrived at their new abode, he applied for
      admission into the Commune of a large village. He stood treat to the
      Elders, and obtained the necessary documents. Five shares of Communal land
      were given him for his own and his sons&rsquo; use: that is to say&mdash;125
      acres (not altogether, but in different fields) besides the use of the
      Communal pasture. Pahom put up the buildings he needed, and bought cattle.
      Of the Communal land alone he had three times as much as at his former
      home, and the land was good corn-land. He was ten times better off than he
      had been. He had plenty of arable land and pasturage, and could keep as
      many head of cattle as he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, in the bustle of building and settling down, Pahom was pleased
      with it all, but when he got used to it he began to think that even here
      he had not enough land. The first year, he sowed wheat on his share of the
      Communal land, and had a good crop. He wanted to go on sowing wheat, but
      had not enough Communal land for the purpose, and what he had already used
      was not available; for in those parts wheat is only sown on virgin soil or
      on fallow land. It is sown for one or two years, and then the land lies
      fallow till it is again overgrown with prairie grass. There were many who
      wanted such land, and there was not enough for all; so that people
      quarrelled about it. Those who were better off, wanted it for growing
      wheat, and those who were poor, wanted it to let to dealers, so that they
      might raise money to pay their taxes. Pahom wanted to sow more wheat; so
      he rented land from a dealer for a year. He sowed much wheat and had a
      fine crop, but the land was too far from the village&mdash;the wheat had
      to be carted more than ten miles. After a time Pahom noticed that some
      peasant-dealers were living on separate farms, and were growing wealthy;
      and he thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were to buy some freehold land, and have a homestead on it, it would
      be a different thing, altogether. Then it would all be nice and compact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question of buying freehold land recurred to him again and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on in the same way for three years; renting land and sowing wheat.
      The seasons turned out well and the crops were good, so that he began to
      lay money by. He might have gone on living contentedly, but he grew tired
      of having to rent other people&rsquo;s land every year, and having to scramble
      for it. Wherever there was good land to be had, the peasants would rush
      for it and it was taken up at once, so that unless you were sharp about it
      you got none. It happened in the third year that he and a dealer together
      rented a piece of pasture land from some peasants; and they had already
      ploughed it up, when there was some dispute, and the peasants went to law
      about it, and things fell out so that the labor was all lost. &ldquo;If it were
      my own land,&rdquo; thought Pahom, &ldquo;I should be independent, and there would not
      be all this unpleasantness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Pahom began looking out for land which he could buy; and he came across
      a peasant who had bought thirteen hundred acres, but having got into
      difficulties was willing to sell again cheap. Pahom bargained and haggled
      with him, and at last they settled the price at 1,500 roubles, part in
      cash and part to be paid later. They had all but clinched the matter, when
      a passing dealer happened to stop at Pahom&rsquo;s one day to get a feed for his
      horse. He drank tea with Pahom, and they had a talk. The dealer said that
      he was just returning from the land of the Bashkirs, far away, where he
      had bought thirteen thousand acres of land all for 1,000 roubles. Pahom
      questioned him further, and the tradesman said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All one need do is to make friends with the chiefs. I gave away about one
      hundred roubles&rsquo; worth of dressing-gowns and carpets, besides a case of
      tea, and I gave wine to those who would drink it; and I got the land for
      less than two cents an acre. And he showed Pahom the title-deeds, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The land lies near a river, and the whole prairie is virgin soil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pahom plied him with questions, and the tradesman said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is more land there than you could cover if you walked a year, and
      it all belongs to the Bashkirs. They are as simple as sheep, and land can
      be got almost for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now,&rdquo; thought Pahom, &ldquo;with my one thousand roubles, why should I
      get only thirteen hundred acres, and saddle myself with a debt besides. If
      I take it out there, I can get more than ten times as much for the money.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p>
      Pahom inquired how to get to the place, and as soon as the tradesman had
      left him, he prepared to go there himself. He left his wife to look after
      the homestead, and started on his journey taking his man with him. They
      stopped at a town on their way, and bought a case of tea, some wine, and
      other presents, as the tradesman had advised. On and on they went until
      they had gone more than three hundred miles, and on the seventh day they
      came to a place where the Bashkirs had pitched their tents. It was all
      just as the tradesman had said. The people lived on the steppes, by a
      river, in felt-covered tents. They neither tilled the ground, nor ate
      bread. Their cattle and horses grazed in herds on the steppe. The colts
      were tethered behind the tents, and the mares were driven to them twice a
      day. The mares were milked, and from the milk kumiss was made. It was the
      women who prepared kumiss, and they also made cheese. As far as the men
      were concerned, drinking kumiss and tea, eating mutton, and playing on
      their pipes, was all they cared about. They were all stout and merry, and
      all the summer long they never thought of doing any work. They were quite
      ignorant, and knew no Russian, but were good-natured enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they saw Pahom, they came out of their tents and gathered round
      their visitor. An interpreter was found, and Pahom told them he had come
      about some land. The Bashkirs seemed very glad; they took Pahom and led
      him into one of the best tents, where they made him sit on some down
      cushions placed on a carpet, while they sat round him. They gave him tea
      and kumiss, and had a sheep killed, and gave him mutton to eat. Pahom took
      presents out of his cart and distributed them among the Bashkirs, and
      divided amongst them the tea. The Bashkirs were delighted. They talked a
      great deal among themselves, and then told the interpreter to translate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wish to tell you,&rdquo; said the interpreter, &ldquo;that they like you, and
      that it is our custom to do all we can to please a guest and to repay him
      for his gifts. You have given us presents, now tell us which of the things
      we possess please you best, that we may present them to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What pleases me best here,&rdquo; answered Pahom, &ldquo;is your land. Our land is
      crowded, and the soil is exhausted; but you have plenty of land and it is
      good land. I never saw the like of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interpreter translated. The Bashkirs talked among themselves for a
      while. Pahom could not understand what they were saying, but saw that they
      were much amused, and that they shouted and laughed. Then they were silent
      and looked at Pahom while the interpreter said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wish me to tell you that in return for your presents they will
      gladly give you as much land as you want. You have only to point it out
      with your hand and it is yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bashkirs talked again for a while and began to dispute. Pahom asked
      what they were disputing about, and the interpreter told him that some of
      them thought they ought to ask their Chief about the land and not act in
      his absence, while others thought there was no need to wait for his
      return.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the Bashkirs were disputing, a man in a large fox-fur cap appeared
      on the scene. They all became silent and rose to their feet. The
      interpreter said, &ldquo;This is our Chief himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pahom immediately fetched the best dressing-gown and five pounds of tea,
      and offered these to the Chief. The Chief accepted them, and seated
      himself in the place of honour. The Bashkirs at once began telling him
      something. The Chief listened for a while, then made a sign with his head
      for them to be silent, and addressing himself to Pahom, said in Russian:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let it be so. Choose whatever piece of land you like; we have
      plenty of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I take as much as I like?&rdquo; thought Pahom. &ldquo;I must get a deed to
      make it secure, or else they may say, &lsquo;It is yours,&rsquo; and afterwards may
      take it away again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for your kind words,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;You have much land, and I
      only want a little. But I should like to be sure which bit is mine. Could
      it not be measured and made over to me? Life and death are in God&rsquo;s hands.
      You good people give it to me, but your children might wish to take it
      away again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; said the Chief. &ldquo;We will make it over to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard that a dealer had been here,&rdquo; continued Pahom, &ldquo;and that you gave
      him a little land, too, and signed title-deeds to that effect. I should
      like to have it done in the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chief understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that can be done quite easily. We have a scribe, and
      we will go to town with you and have the deed properly sealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will be the price?&rdquo; asked Pahom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our price is always the same: one thousand roubles a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pahom did not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A day? What measure is that? How many acres would that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not know how to reckon it out,&rdquo; said the Chief. &ldquo;We sell it by the
      day. As much as you can go round on your feet in a day is yours, and the
      price is one thousand roubles a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pahom was surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in a day you can get round a large tract of land,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will all be yours!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But there is one condition: If you don&rsquo;t
      return on the same day to the spot whence you started, your money is
      lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how am I to mark the way that I have gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we shall go to any spot you like, and stay there. You must start
      from that spot and make your round, taking a spade with you. Wherever you
      think necessary, make a mark. At every turning, dig a hole and pile up the
      turf; then afterwards we will go round with a plough from hole to hole.
      You may make as large a circuit as you please, but before the sun sets you
      must return to the place you started from. All the land you cover will be
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pahom was delighted. It-was decided to start early next morning. They
      talked a while, and after drinking some more kumiss and eating some more
      mutton, they had tea again, and then the night came on. They gave Pahom a
      feather-bed to sleep on, and the Bashkirs dispersed for the night,
      promising to assemble the next morning at daybreak and ride out before
      sunrise to the appointed spot.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pahom lay on the feather-bed, but could not sleep. He kept thinking about
      the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a large tract I will mark off!&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;I can easily go
      thirty-five miles in a day. The days are long now, and within a circuit of
      thirty-five miles what a lot of land there will be! I will sell the poorer
      land, or let it to peasants, but I&rsquo;ll pick out the best and farm it. I
      will buy two ox-teams, and hire two more laborers. About a hundred and
      fifty acres shall be plough-land, and I will pasture cattle on the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pahom lay awake all night, and dozed off only just before dawn. Hardly
      were his eyes closed when he had a dream. He thought he was lying in that
      same tent, and heard somebody chuckling outside. He wondered who it could
      be, and rose and went out, and he saw the Bashkir Chief sitting in front
      of the tent holding his side and rolling about with laughter. Going nearer
      to the Chief, Pahom asked: &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; But he saw that it
      was no longer the Chief, but the dealer who had recently stopped at his
      house and had told him about the land. Just as Pahom was going to ask,
      &ldquo;Have you been here long?&rdquo; he saw that it was not the dealer, but the
      peasant who had come up from the Volga, long ago, to Pahom&rsquo;s old home.
      Then he saw that it was not the peasant either, but the Devil himself with
      hoofs and horns, sitting there and chuckling, and before him lay a man
      barefoot, prostrate on the ground, with only trousers and a shirt on. And
      Pahom dreamt that he looked more attentively to see what sort of a man it
      was lying there, and he saw that the man was dead, and that it was
      himself! He awoke horror-struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things one does dream,&rdquo; thought he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking round he saw through the open door that the dawn was breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to wake them up,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;We ought to be starting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up, roused his man (who was sleeping in his cart), bade him
      harness; and went to call the Bashkirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to go to the steppe to measure the land,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bashkirs rose and assembled, and the Chief came, too. Then they began
      drinking kumiss again, and offered Pahom some tea, but he would not wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we are to go, let us go. It is high time,&rdquo; said he.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Bashkirs got ready and they all started: some mounted on horses, and
      some in carts. Pahom drove in his own small cart with his servant, and
      took a spade with him. When they reached the steppe, the morning red was
      beginning to kindle. They ascended a hillock (called by the Bashkirs a
      shikhan) and dismounting from their carts and their horses, gathered in
      one spot. The Chief came up to Pahom and stretched out his arm towards the
      plain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all this, as far as your eye can reach, is ours. You may
      have any part of it you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pahom&rsquo;s eyes glistened: it was all virgin soil, as flat as the palm of
      your hand, as black as the seed of a poppy, and in the hollows different
      kinds of grasses grew breast high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chief took off his fox-fur cap, placed it on the ground and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be the mark. Start from here, and return here again. All the
      land you go round shall be yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pahom took out his money and put it on the cap. Then he took off his outer
      coat, remaining in his sleeveless under coat. He unfastened his girdle and
      tied it tight below his stomach, put a little bag of bread into the breast
      of his coat, and tying a flask of water to his girdle, he drew up the tops
      of his boots, took the spade from his man, and stood ready to start. He
      considered for some moments which way he had better go&mdash;it was
      tempting everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I will go towards the rising sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned his face to the east, stretched himself, and waited for the sun
      to appear above the rim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must lose no time,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and it is easier walking while it is
      still cool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun&rsquo;s rays had hardly flashed above the horizon, before Pahom,
      carrying the spade over his shoulder, went down into the steppe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pahom started walking neither slowly nor quickly. After having gone a
      thousand yards he stopped, dug a hole and placed pieces of turf one on
      another to make it more visible. Then he went on; and now that he had
      walked off his stiffness he quickened his pace. After a while he dug
      another hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pahom looked back. The hillock could be distinctly seen in the sunlight,
      with the people on it, and the glittering tires of the cartwheels. At a
      rough guess Pahom concluded that he had walked three miles. It was growing
      warmer; he took off his under-coat, flung it across his shoulder, and went
      on again. It had grown quite warm now; he looked at the sun, it was time
      to think of breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first shift is done, but there are four in a day, and it is too soon
      yet to turn. But I will just take off my boots,&rdquo; said he to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, took off his boots, stuck them into his girdle, and went on.
      It was easy walking now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go on for another three miles,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;and then turn to the
      left. The spot is so fine, that it would be a pity to lose it. The further
      one goes, the better the land seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went straight on a for a while, and when he looked round, the hillock
      was scarcely visible and the people on it looked like black ants, and he
      could just see something glistening there in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; thought Pahom, &ldquo;I have gone far enough in this direction, it is time
      to turn. Besides I am in a regular sweat, and very thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, dug a large hole, and heaped up pieces of turf. Next he untied
      his flask, had a drink, and then turned sharply to the left. He went on
      and on; the grass was high, and it was very hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pahom began to grow tired: he looked at the sun and saw that it was noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I must have a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, and ate some bread and drank some water; but he did not lie
      down, thinking that if he did he might fall asleep. After sitting a little
      while, he went on again. At first he walked easily: the food had
      strengthened him; but it had become terribly hot, and he felt sleepy;
      still he went on, thinking: &ldquo;An hour to suffer, a life-time to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went a long way in this direction also, and was about to turn to the
      left again, when he perceived a damp hollow: &ldquo;It would be a pity to leave
      that out,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Flax would do well there.&rdquo; So he went on past the
      hollow, and dug a hole on the other side of it before he turned the
      corner. Pahom looked towards the hillock. The heat made the air hazy: it
      seemed to be quivering, and through the haze the people on the hillock
      could scarcely be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought Pahom, &ldquo;I have made the sides too long; I must make this one
      shorter.&rdquo; And he went along the third side, stepping faster. He looked at
      the sun: it was nearly half way to the horizon, and he had not yet done
      two miles of the third side of the square. He was still ten miles from the
      goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;though it will make my land lopsided, I must hurry back
      in a straight line now. I might go too far, and as it is I have a great
      deal of land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Pahom hurriedly dug a hole, and turned straight towards the hillock.
    </p>

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Pahom went straight towards the hillock, but he now walked with
      difficulty. He was done up with the heat, his bare feet were cut and
      bruised, and his legs began to fail. He longed to rest, but it was
      impossible if he meant to get back before sunset. The sun waits for no
      man, and it was sinking lower and lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;if only I have not blundered trying for too much!
      What if I am too late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked towards the hillock and at the sun. He was still far from his
      goal, and the sun was already near the rim. Pahom walked on and on; it was
      very hard walking, but he went quicker and quicker. He pressed on, but was
      still far from the place. He began running, threw away his coat, his
      boots, his flask, and his cap, and kept only the spade which he used as a
      support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I do,&rdquo; he thought again, &ldquo;I have grasped too much, and ruined
      the whole affair. I can&rsquo;t get there before the sun sets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this fear made him still more breathless. Pahom went on running, his
      soaking shirt and trousers stuck to him, and his mouth was parched. His
      breast was working like a blacksmith&rsquo;s bellows, his heart was beating like
      a hammer, and his legs were giving way as if they did not belong to him.
      Pahom was seized with terror lest he should die of the strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though afraid of death, he could not stop. &ldquo;After having run all that way
      they will call me a fool if I stop now,&rdquo; thought he. And he ran on and on,
      and drew near and heard the Bashkirs yelling and shouting to him, and
      their cries inflamed his heart still more. He gathered his last strength
      and ran on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was close to the rim, and cloaked in mist looked large, and red as
      blood. Now, yes now, it was about to set! The sun was quite low, but he
      was also quite near his aim. Pahom could already see the people on the
      hillock waving their arms to hurry him up. He could see the fox-fur cap on
      the ground, and the money on it, and the Chief sitting on the ground
      holding his sides. And Pahom remembered his dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is plenty of land,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;but will God let me live on it? I
      have lost my life, I have lost my life! I shall never reach that spot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pahom looked at the sun, which had reached the earth: one side of it had
      already disappeared. With all his remaining strength he rushed on, bending
      his body forward so that his legs could hardly follow fast enough to keep
      him from falling. Just as he reached the hillock it suddenly grew dark. He
      looked up&mdash;the sun had already set. He gave a cry: &ldquo;All my labor has
      been in vain,&rdquo; thought he, and was about to stop, but he heard the
      Bashkirs still shouting, and remembered that though to him, from below,
      the sun seemed to have set, they on the hillock could still see it. He
      took a long breath and ran up the hillock. It was still light there. He
      reached the top and saw the cap. Before it sat the Chief laughing and
      holding his sides. Again Pahom remembered his dream, and he uttered a cry:
      his legs gave way beneath him, he fell forward and reached the cap with
      his hands.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
